He banned brit milah (circumcision) and ordered pigs to be sacrificed at the altar of the temple. The festival of Hanukkah commemorates the uprising of the Maccabees against this attempt. 175 BCE-165 BCE.   |.   wikipedia: Some modern scholars, following the account in 2 Maccabees, observe that the king was intervening in an internal civil war between the Maccabean Jews and the Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem.[54][55][56][57] These competed violently over who would be the High Priest, with traditionalists with Hebrew/Aramaic names like Onias contesting with Hellenizing High Priests with Greek names like Jason and Menelaus.[58] In particular, Jason's Hellenistic reforms would prove to be a decisive factor leading to eventual conflict within the ranks of Judaism.[59] Other authors point to possible socioeconomic reasons in addition to the religious reasons behind the civil war.[60]What began in many respects as a civil war escalated when the Hellenistic kingdom of Syria sided with the Hellenizing Jews in their conflict with the traditionalists.[61] As the conflict escalated, Antiochus took the side of the Hellenizers by prohibiting the religious practices the traditionalists had rallied around. This may explain why the king, in a total departure from Seleucid practice in all other places and times, banned a traditional religion.[62]The miracle of the oil is widely regarded as a legend and its authenticity has been questioned since the Middle Ages.[63] However, given the famous question Joseph Karo (1488-1575) posed concerning why Hanukkah is celebrated for eight days when the miracle was only for seven days (since there was enough oil for one day),[64] it was clear that writing in the 16th century CE, he believed it to be a historical event. This belief has been adopted by most of Orthodox Judaism, in as much as Karo's Shulchan Aruch is a main code of Jewish Law. The menorah first began to be used as a symbol of Judaism in the Hasmonean period – appearing on coins issued by Hasmonean king Mattathias Antigonus between 40 and 37 BCE,[65] but these coins depict a seven-branched Temple menorah, not a nine-branched vessel that would correspond to an eight-day oil miracl",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,," the expulsion of Jews was not directly related to the events surrounding the attempted erection of a statue of Zeus, the ban on circumcision, or the sacrifice of pigs at the temple altar by Antiochus IV Epiphanes.

Succeeding his brother Titus in the government, he provoked the vigorous resistance of the aristocracy by his despotic measures, which aimed at the complete supersession of the powers of the Senate. His mistrust and financial embarrassment drove him, after a short period of moderation and good administration, to sanguinary measures. He maintained the pagan faith against the various dissenting sects; and twice (89 and 95) expelled the philosophers from Rome. He dealt most severely with converts to either Judaism or Christianity, the penalty being either death or confiscation of property. Even his cousin, the consul Flavius Clemens, was put to death for embracing the Jewish faith; while the latter's wife Domitilla was exiled to the isle of Pandataria (95). The severe measures projected at this time against the Jews, which occasioned the journey to Rome of R. Gamaliel and his colleagues, were frustrated probably by Domitian's assassination.

358,Armenia,Zoroastrianism,Transitionary - Sasanian Empire conquering Kingdom of Armenia,Feudal monarchy,"Some historians claim that King Tigranes the Great brought 10,000 Jewish captives with him to the ancient Kingdom of Armenia, following a retreat from Judea due to a Roman attack on Armenia.  A large Jewish population was settled in Armenia from the first century BCE, thus establishing a permanent Jewish community there. During this period, numerous regional powers attempted to divide and conquer the country, and as a result, the Jewish population (and the general Armenian population as well) suffered the consequences of invasions, occupations, and reconquests. By the third century CE, there was a huge increase in Jewish immigration from the Hellenistic region. As a result, some Armenian towns became largely Jewish. The conquest of Armenia by the Sassanids under King Shapur II in the following century saw the deportations of Jews. Thousands of Jewish families were deported to areas throughout the region, including Esfahan (modern Iran), Artashat, Vaghasabat, Yervandashat, Sarehavan, Sarisat, Van, and Nakhichevan. https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/about/communities/AM| wikipedia makes a point of saying King Shapur II: Shapur II pursued a harsh religious policy. Under his reign, the collection of the Avesta, the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism, was completed, heresy and apostasy were punished, and Christians were persecuted. The latter was a reaction against the Christianization of the Roman Empire by Constantine the Great. Shapur II, like Shapur I, was amicable towards Jews, who lived in relative freedom and gained many advantages in his period (see also Rava). At the time of Shapur's death, the Sasanian Empire was stronger than ever, with its enemies to the east pacified and Armenia under Sasanian control.

1189,"London, England",Christianity,Kingdom of England,Feudal Monarchy,"A Jewish deputation attending coronation of Richard the Lionheart was attacked by the crowd. Pogroms in London followed and spread around England. | From 1189 to 1190, the anti-Jewish pogroms in London, York, and numerous other cities and towns displayed cruelty and barbarity never before seen by English Jews. Indeed, these acts of violence distinguished themselves as some of the worst atrocities committed against European Jews in the Middle Ages. If this is true, then what drove the English, who hadn’t previously committed acts of violence against the Jews, to kill their neighbours?In order to understand the reason why the pogroms of 1189 and 1190 occurred, the early history of the Jews in England must be explained. Prior to 1066, no Jews were recorded living in the kingdom. However, during the Norman Conquest, William the Conqueror brought England’s first Jews from Rouen, France. According to the Domesday Book, William wanted the government’s dues to be paid in coin, not by kind, and he saw the Jews as a nation of people who could supply him and the kingdom with coin. Therefore, William the Conqueror viewed the Jews as an important financial asset, one which could fund the kingdom’s ventures. During the reign of King Henry II (r. 1154 – 1189), English Jews prospered economically, with Aaron of Lincoln, a Jewish financier, becoming one of the richest men in all of England. Jews were able to build themselves houses of stone, a material which was usually reserved for palaces. Jews and Christians lived side by side, and clergymen from both religions often met together and debated theological issues. By the end of Henry II’s reign, however, increasing Jewish financial success had incurred the anger of the English aristocracy, and a rising desire to crusade among the kingdom’s populace proved to be deadly for England’s Jews. The catalyst for the anti-Jewish violence in 1189 and 1190 was the coronation of King Richard I on September 3, 1189. In addition to Richard’s Christian subjects, many prominent English Jews arrived at Westminster Abbey to pay homage to their new king. However, many Christian Englishmen harbored superstitions against Jews being present at such a holy occasion, and the Jewish attendees were flogged and thrown out of the banquet following the coronation. After the incident at Westminster Abbey, a rumor spread that Richard had ordered the English to kill the Jews.

When news of the slaughter reached King Richard, he was outraged, but only managed to punish a few of the assailants because of their large numbers.When Richard left on the Third Crusade, the Jews of the village of King’s Lynn attacked a Jew who converted to Christianity.

However, local noblemen Richard Malebisse, William Percy, Marmeduke Darell, and Philip de Fauconberg saw the pogrom as an opportunity to erase the large amount of debt they owed to Jewish moneylenders. The pogrom began when a mob burned the house of Benedict of York, a Jewish moneylender who died during the London pogrom, and killed his widow and children. York’s remaining Jews sought refuge in the town’s castle to escape the mob and convinced the castle’s warden to let them inside. However, when the warden requested to re-enter the castle, the frightened Jews refused, and local militiamen and noblemen besieged the castle. The anger of the English was fueled by the death of a monk, who was crushed by a stone when he approached the castle. The pogroms of 1189 and 1190 were catastrophic for England’s Jewish community. Vandalism, arson and massacres showed English Jews that the tolerance of their Christian neighbours was a thing of the past. The zeal of the Crusades stirred up a fanatical religiosity among the English populace, a sensation that drove people to commit atrocities in the name of Christ.

1190,England,Christianity,Kingdom of England,Feudal Monarchy,"massacre of jews in England| A Jewish deputation attending coronation of Richard the Lionheart was attacked by the crowd. Pogroms in London followed and spread around England. | From 1189 to 1190, the anti-Jewish pogroms in London, York, and numerous other cities and towns displayed cruelty and barbarity never before seen by English Jews. Indeed, these acts of violence distinguished themselves as some of the worst atrocities committed against European Jews in the Middle Ages. If this is true, then what drove the English, who hadn’t previously committed acts of violence against the Jews, to kill their neighbours?In order to understand the reason why the pogroms of 1189 and 1190 occurred, the early history of the Jews in England must be explained. Prior to 1066, no Jews were recorded living in the kingdom. However, during the Norman Conquest, William the Conqueror brought England’s first Jews from Rouen, France. According to the Domesday Book, William wanted the government’s dues to be paid in coin, not by kind, and he saw the Jews as a nation of people who could supply him and the kingdom with coin. Therefore, William the Conqueror viewed the Jews as an important financial asset, one which could fund the kingdom’s ventures. During the reign of King Henry II (r. 1154 – 1189), English Jews prospered economically, with Aaron of Lincoln, a Jewish financier, becoming one of the richest men in all of England. Jews were able to build themselves houses of stone, a material which was usually reserved for palaces. Jews and Christians lived side by side, and clergymen from both religions often met together and debated theological issues. By the end of Henry II’s reign, however, increasing Jewish financial success had incurred the anger of the English aristocracy, and a rising desire to crusade among the kingdom’s populace proved to be deadly for England’s Jews. The catalyst for the anti-Jewish violence in 1189 and 1190 was the coronation of King Richard I on September 3, 1189. In addition to Richard’s Christian subjects, many prominent English Jews arrived at Westminster Abbey to pay homage to their new king. However, many Christian Englishmen harbored superstitions against Jews being present at such a holy occasion, and the Jewish attendees were flogged and thrown out of the banquet following the coronation. After the incident at Westminster Abbey, a rumor spread that Richard had ordered the English to kill the Jews. Christians attacked the predominantly Jewish neighborhood of Old Jewry, setting the Jews’ stone houses on fire at night and killing those who tried to escape. When news of the slaughter reached King Richard, he was outraged, but only managed to punish a few of the assailants because of their large numbers.When Richard left on the Third Crusade, the Jews of the village of King’s Lynn attacked a Jew who converted to Christianity.

Upon that time, the city's demographics featured a heterogeneous composition, with both Mozarabs, Muslims and Jewish communities, to which incoming Christians from northern Iberia and Frankish elements added up, so, initially, different fueros were simultaneously in force for each community.[40] After the Christian conquest, the city's Mozarab community grew by immigration from the Muslim south.[41]Toledo preserved its status as a cultural centre; and a tag-team translation centre was established in which books in Arabic or Hebrew would be translated into Castilian by Muslim and Jewish scholars, and from Castilian into Latin by Castilian scholars, thus letting long-lost knowledge spread through Christian Europe again. Under the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toledo multiple persecutions (633, 653, 693) and stake burnings of Jews (638 CE) occurred; the Kingdom of Toledo followed up on this tradition (1368, 1391, 1449, 1486–1490 CE) including forced conversions and mass murder and the rioting and blood bath against the Jews of Toledo (1212 CE).[42][43]A major popular revolt erupted in Toledo in 1449, with elements of tax mutiny, antisemitic and anticonverso sentiment, and appeals to the civic community, managing to expand from an urban revolt to some anti-seigneurial riots in countryside settlements of the hinterland of Toledo.[44]",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,,forced conversions,Inclusion Incongruence

As the procession reached the Calle de la Herreria (""street of the smiths""), in the vicinity of the cathedral and the Juderia, the signal for assault was given. A smith, Alonzo Rodriguez by name, seized the torch illuminating an image of Mary, and set fire to the house of one of the richest Maranos of the city—an act which he averred to have committed out of vengeance, because water had been poured from one of the windows of the house in question upon the canopy under which the image was placed. In explanation of this charge it is said that a Marano girl, eight or ten years of age, had indeed inadvertently poured some water from the window. With the cry of ""Viva la fé de Dios,"" the fanatical mob broke into the houses of the Maranos, pillaged and burned them, and mercilessly slaughtered the inmates. In order to terminate this cruelty, the governor, Alfonso de Aguilar, accompanied by his brother, Gonçalo Fernandez de Cordova, and several knights, ordered the smith, who acted as leader, to withdraw with his band. The smith answered with a volley of abuse, while the enraged mob attacked the governor, who thereupon ran the smith through with a lance. The governor's action infuriated the mob to such a degree that it poured into the streets inhabited by the Maranos—the S. Maria de Gracia, La Roperia (""street of the pedlers""), La Curtiduria (""street of the tanners""), La Alcaiceria (""the silk-market""), La Plateria (""street of the goldsmiths""), and many others, all of which soon ran with the blood of the slaughtered. De Aguilar was obliged to withdraw to the Alcazar, which also served as a place of refuge for many Jews and Maranos. After the storm had subsided the governor was obliged to leave Cordova; and he proceeded to Aguilar, whither he was followed by many Jews and Maranos. In 1473 an order was issued prohibiting Maranos from holding public office in Cordova; and this was soon followed by another royal decree prohibiting Jews from residing in that city and in Seville under penalty of death.

The most violent attack took place on April 8, 1484, when bands of farm laborers from Dauphiné, Auvergne, and the Provençal highlands, assisted by citizens of Arles, invaded the Jewish street, looting and partially destroying it. Havoc was caused to the synagogue, already damaged by fire, possibly in 1457; two women were killed in the disorders and some 50 males were compelled to adopt Christianity. Similar disorders recurred in the following year but the municipal officers intervened to protect the Jews more effectively.

The favorable attitude toward the Jews which had characterized the Lithuanian rulers for generations was unexpectedly and radically changed by a decree promulgated by Alexander in April 1495. By this decree all Jews living in Lithuania proper and the adjacent territories were summarily ordered to leave the country.The expulsion was evidently not accompanied by the usual cruelties; for there was no popular animosity toward the Lithuanian Jews, and the decree was regarded as an act of mere willfulness on the part of an absolute ruler. Some of the nobility, however, approved Alexander's decree, expecting to profit by the departure of their Jewish creditors, as is indicated by numerous lawsuits on the return of the exiles to Lithuania in 1503. It is known from the Hebrew sources that some of the exiles migrated to Crimea, and that by far the greater number settled in Poland, where, by permission of King John I Albert, they established themselves in towns situated near the Lithuanian boundary. This permission, given at first for a period of two years, was extended ""because of the extreme poverty of the Jews on account of the great losses sustained by them.""

The survivors who returned to their old homes in the latter half of the 17th century were practically destitute. The wars which raged constantly in the Lithuanian territory brought ruin to the entire country and deprived the Jews of the opportunity to earn more than a bare livelihood. The intensity of their struggle for existence left them no time to reestablish the conditions which had existed up to 1648. John Casimir (1648–1668) sought to ameliorate their condition by granting various concessions to the Jewish communities of Lithuania. Attempts to return to the old order in the communal organization were not wanting, as is evident from contemporary documents. Thus in 1672, Jewish elders from various towns and villages in the grand duchy of Lithuania secured a charter from King Michael Wiśniowiecki (1669–1673), decreeing ""that on account of the increasing number of Jews guilty of offenses against the Shlyakhta and other Christians, which result in the enmity of the Christians toward the Jews, and because of the inability of the Jewish elders to punish such offenders, who are protected by the lords, the king permits the kahals to summon the criminals before the Jewish courts for punishment and exclusion from the community when necessary."" The efforts to resurrect the old power of the kahals were not successful. The impoverished Jewish merchants, having no capital of their own, were compelled to borrow money from the nobility, from churches, congregations, monasteries, and various religious orders. Loans from the latter were usually for an unlimited period and were secured by mortgages on the real estate of the kahal. The kahals thus became hopelessly indebted to the clergy and the nobility. | The Khmelnytsky Uprising,[a] also known as the Cossack–Polish War,[1] or the Khmelnytsky insurrection,[2] was a Cossack rebellion that took place between 1648 and 1657 in the eastern territories of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which led to the creation of a Cossack Hetmanate in Ukraine.

Under Ottoman rule the economic decline of Buda, the capital city of Hungary, was characterized by the stagnation of population. The population of Buda was not larger in 1686, than the population of the city two centuries earlier in the 15th century.[5] The Ottomans allowed the Hungarian royal palace to fall into ruins.[6] The amortized palace was later transformed into a gunpowder storage and magazine by the Ottomans,[7] which caused its detonation during the siege in 1686. The original Christian Hungarian population did not feel secure during the Ottoman conquest, their numbers significantly shrank in the next decades, because they fled to the Habsburg ruled Royal Hungary.

Possibly as a reward, Henry Pelham in 1753 brought in the Jew Bill of 1753, which allowed Jews to become naturalised by application to Parliament. It passed the Lords without much opposition, but on being brought down to the House of Commons, the Tories made protest against what they deemed an ""abandonment of Christianity."" The Whigs, however, persisted in carrying out at least one part of their general policy of religious toleration, and the bill was passed and received royal assent (26 Geo. 2. c. 26). The public reacted with an enormous outburst of antisemitism, and the Bill was repealed in the next sitting of Parliament, in 1754.[4]Horace Walpole, a contemporary observer, said that the Act removed ""such absurd distinctions, as stigmatized and shackled a body of the most loyal, commercial and wealthy subjects of the kingdom""; the affair demonstrated that ""the age, enlightened as it is called, was still enslaved to the grossest and most vulgar prejudices"".[5] The political economist Josiah Tucker defended the Act in A Letter to A Friend Concerning Naturalizations (1753), where he pointed to the economic benefits of granting naturalisation to Jewish people:As to the Bill itself, it only empowers rich Foreigners to purchase Lands, and to carry on a free and extensive Commerce, by importing all Sorts of Merchandise and Raw Materials, allowed by Law to be imported, for the Employment of our own People, and then Exporting the Surplus of the Produce, Labour, and Manufactures of our own Country, upon cheaper and better Terms than is done at present. This is all the Hurt that such a Bill can do.[6][7]While the Sephardim chiefly congregated in London as the centre of international commerce, Jews immigrating from Germany and Poland settled for the most part in the seaports of the south and west, such as Falmouth, Plymouth, Liverpool, Bristol, etc., as pawnbrokers and small dealers. From these centres it became their custom to send out hawkers every Monday with packs to the neighbouring villages, whereby connections were made with some of the inland towns, where they began to settle, such as Canterbury, Chatham, Cambridge, Manchester, and Birmingham.

His brief disappearance sparked a rumor that “the Jews killed a tailor” and although an official of the Jewish community found Fux and paraded him through the streets, the riot took on a life of its own and provoked widespread destruction, not only in the Gołubskie Palace, but also in the adjacent Pociejowski Palace. Violence was directed against Jews but was also aimed at the szlachta whose use of jurydyki to evade regulations on Jewish settlement was bitterly resented. Strong action was taken against those responsible, but it was clear how much resistance there was to a change in the Jews’ position. Given this situation, it is not surprising that although the status of towns was improved in the constitution adopted on 3 May 1791, nothing was done to ease the Jews’ position, which actually worsened as a consequence of the abolition of the jurydyki (legally different from rest of town attractive from disliked groups or considered not part of the group) and the creation of a single magistracy in Warsaw.

Supported by the regency (needs source) the company expanded its business at sea, and many European governments entrusted them with the management of their Algerian money affairs. During the dearth of food in France they supplied the latter with a considerable quantity of wheat on credit; and on their advice, the Dey authorized a loan to the French Directory of five million francs, the credit for which was eventually transferred to them.The settlement of this loan brought about thirty years later the definitive rupture between the regency and France, and, finally, the conquest of Algeria by the French. On the assassination of Busnash and the anti-Jewish riots which followed it, the firm ""Bakri Busnash"" became insolvent; and David himself was thrown into prison under the pretext that the firm owed the regency a sum of five million francs. Set free on a promise to pay the alleged debt, he soon built up the firm ""Bakri,"" owing to the help he received from several European governments for the services he had rendered them. He even succeeded in winning the confidence of the new Dey, who appointed him in 1806 chief of the Algerian Jews. This post proved fatal to him.

The penultimate sentence of the same paragraph is known as the Jesuit clause (Norwegian: Jesuittparagrafen).The clause roughly translates as:The Evangelical-Lutheran religion is the state's public religion. The inhabitants who practice it are obliged to raise their children in the same. Jesuits and monastic orders must not be tolerated. Jews are excluded from access to the Kingdom.Christian Magnus Falsen, Georg Sverdrup and Nicolai Wergeland were the central delegates behind the wording of the section's final paragraph. The wording was adopted on May 4, 1814. Those behind the law were highly educated and among the country's most well-read men.[2][3] This paragraph was finalized in Constitutional Committee and adopted after discussion, but without changes in the plenary.The ban on Jews was quickly enforced. By the end of 1814, the first suspected Jews were already being expelled or banished.[16] Four men were exiled from Bergen at the end of 1814 after pressure from the local merchant class. Fear of competition from Jewish merchants was an important driving force behind the enforcement of the clause.[17][18] But they were not fined or arrested. Only at the end of the 1820s were the penal provisions of Christian V's Norwegian Code used. In 1822, the king, the government and the parliament chose to completely ignore that the Constitution was violated. Norway was in financial crisis. A large installment on the national debt to Denmark was due, but Norway could not pay. King Charles XIV John threatened to put Norway under the Swedish constitution if the installment was not paid. Norwegian independence was in danger. Danish Joseph Hambro and Swedish Vilhelm Benedicks came to Norway twice that year to negotiate government debt. The former represented the financial house Hambro, the latter the financial house Michaelson & Bendicks. Both were Jews. A state loan from Hambro was the saving grace for Norway. The national debt and the loan crisis led to a pragmatic approach to the Jewish clause, according to historian Frode Ulvund [no].[2]In the difficult years after 1814, Finance Minister Herman Wedel Jarlsberg had tried to borrow money from banks in London. Because of the Jewish clause in the Constitution, he could not get a loan from Rothschild, and Rothschild had convinced the other banks in London to boycott the Norwegian state.[19]In 1844, Emanuel Philipson and Leon Lopez were arrested in Christiania (today Oslo) after a raid on Lütken's billiard hall. The police found out that the two had broken the Jew clause. Lopez was released under an exemption for ""Portuguese Jews""; Philipson was imprisoned for 30 days because he could not pay the fine of 800 specidaler (a considerable sum at the time). Morgenbladet wrote in a commentary that the two had contributed to ""reinforcing the rather widespread belief that the country will be overrun by swindlers and fraudsters [Skakrere og Bedragere] if the ban on Jews entering the kingdom is lifted"". Skakrere was at that time a derogatory term for Jewish itinerant merchants, synonymous with swindler. Andreas Munch wrote a satirical play based on Morgenbladet's views and polemics with its more liberal competitor, Den Constitutionelle. Adolph Tidemand drew the caricature ""Jødenes mottagelse i Christiania"" ('the Jews' reception in Christiania') based on the episode. Henrik Wergeland expressed no sympathy for the two, whom he described as ""scoundrels of Jews"".[20]",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,,Only exception was Portugeese Jews for something specific (even turned down Rothschild who convinced others not to loan to Norway); conversion to Christianity specifically one sect required,Homogenous Reset

These unpaid debts were the cause of diplomatic incidents that resulted in the French conquest of Algiers in 1830. (JVL)| The Bakri-Busnach affair (French: L'affaire Bakri-Busnach) is the name of a commercial–political conflict between France and Algeria in the early 19th century; it centered on France's obligations to a commercial company owned by the Algerian Jewish families of Bakri and Bujanah. The affair is considered one of the causes of the French invasion of Algeria in 1830. additional rumors included that the dey of Algeria at that time got into an argument on behalf of having those families paid (perhaps he was going to take a cut??) and this is how that devolved suppoesedly: On 30 April 1827, foreign consuls and diplomatic agents gathered in Algeria for a conference with Algerian ruler Hussein Dey. On this occasion, Hussein Dey publicly asked the French consul whether France intended to meet the debt settlement and whether it had begun transferring the funds. When he heard that no progress had yet been made on the issue, he was filled with anger and struck the French consul in the face with the handle of a fly-whisk that was in his hands. According to another version, Hussein Dey simply wanted to hit a disturbing fly and accidentally hit the French consul.The French government treated the incident as a public insult and demanded an immediate apology. Failure to respond began with punitive measures, and the French navy launched a naval siege on the port of Algiers, which lasted 3 years. This action harmed the French economy, which conducted extensive trade relations with Algeria, no less than it harmed Algeria itself, so the French tried to resort to international mediation. They approached, among others, the Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II and Muhammad Ali, the ruler of Egypt, with the aim of mediating between it and Algeria, but this did not bear fruit. In 1830, France invaded Algeria and successfully conquered it – an occupation that lasted until the 1960s. The French invasion of Algeria stemmed from many considerations, most notably internal considerations of the French statesmen, but the Bakri-Busnach affair was one of the most important immediate factors and even served as an unofficial case for the invasion. However, the changes caused some to leave: many European Jews returned to Leghorn, and the middle class, small tradesmen, and craftsmen emigrated to Morocco and Tunisia. On the other hand, Moroccan and Tunisian Jews, attracted by new conditions, immigrated into Algeria.

'God's Justice') was an 1839 pogrom perpetrated by Muslims against the Mashhadi Jewish community in the city of Mashhad, Qajar Iran. It was characterized by the mass-killing and forced conversion of the Jews in the area to Islam. https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/2013-03-19/ty-article/.premium/1839-persia-to-jews-convert-or-die/0000017f-dc7a-db5a-a57f-dc7a3bf40000| After a mob of Shi'ite fundamentalists burned the Jewish quarter of Meshed, Persia, and forcibly converted the entire Jewish population, a wave of Jews fled to Bukhara. They mostly settled in the Bukharan cities of Shahrisabz and Merv. (JVL)| The Allahdad incident was a prominent event in the ambivalent history of Jewish–Muslim relations because an entire community of Jews were forced to convert, and it was one of the first times European Jewry intervened on behalf of Iranian Jews.[1]| In another narrative of the same event this incident happened during the Shia holy month on Muharram. The Shias were marching in the streets in memory of Hussein ibn Ali when the Jewish woman was throwing away the dog she killed for medical reasons. She was accused of deliberately offending the shi'is.[3]Still another narrative reports that the dog was only a pretext and the conflict was because of earlier confrontations between a Sayyid (descendant of Muhammad) and the Jews who did not want to pay him for the husainia he built near the Jewish commercial shops.[4]In any case the recommendation by a Muslim physician seems unlikely as both Islamic and Jewish laws would consider dog's blood to be impure.Mashhad's ruler[clarification needed] had ordered his men to enter Jewish homes and mobs attacked the Jewish community, burning down the synagogue, looting homes, abducting girls, and killing between 30 and 40 people. With knives held to their throats, the Jewish patriarchs were forced to vocally proclaim their ""allegiance"" to Islam as it was agreed upon by the leaders of the community that in order to save the remaining 2,400 Jews, everyone must convert. Most converted and stayed in Mashhad, taking on Muslim names, while some left for other Iranian Jewish communities and to Afghanistan. That day became known as the Allahdad (""God’s Justice"").[5]This event might also be understood in larger Jewish-Persian relations. Many Jews of Mashhad, including the chief of the local Jewish community, Mullah Mahdi Aqajan, served as agents of the British government. This fact in addition to recent withdrawal of Iran from Herat in 1838 under diplomatic pressure from the British government, created an increasingly hostile atmosphere towards the Jews in Mashhad.[6] Few years after the incident with the intervention of Moses Montefiore the head of British Jewry at the time, Jews were allowed by Muhammad Shah's decree to return to Judaism. However most Jews fearing the anger of the local population decided to live outwardly as Muslims and living as crypto-Jews.[7] On the outside, they acted as Muslims: their clothes, names, and lifestyles resembled those of their Iranian neighbors. At home, however, they secretly taught their children to read Hebrew, lit candles, and observed Shabbat.[8] Some Mashhadi Jews did not feel safe in Mashhad anymore and decided to move to other cities in the area such as Bukhara and Samarqand. A large group moved to Herat in present-day Afghanistan, where the majority of the Muslims were Sunni and more tolerant of the Jews than the Shiites",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,Bukhara; Samarqand; Herat;,forced conversions to Islam after longstanding tensions including outgroup forwarding behavior,Inclusion Incongruence

Despite this burden, and despite the hostility of the population, the Jewish merchants of Coro prospered. Historian Isidoro Aizenberg, writing in the journal of the American Jewish Historical Society (AJHS), observed, “Their success could not have gone unnoticed, either by the population or the government.”Starting in the 1840s, the municipal government of Coro and the local military garrison asked the Jewish community for loans as advances against their taxes. These were made interest free, and at times were simply “voluntary” contributions as it became clear that the loans would not be repaid. Aizenberg notes, “With the passing of time these payments became not a financial resource which the government could tap in case of urgent need, but a regular source of funds which it came to expect as a matter of course.”Fearing that the local military would grow powerful at the expense of civilian rule, the national government of Venezuela asked the Jews of Coro not to pay these unauthorized levies to fund salaries for the local garrison. The Jewish community acquiesced to the central government’s request and declined meet yet another request for funds. On January 30, 1855, unable to meet the payroll, the military command at Coro dismissed the troops quartered there.The next day, a handbill circulated the city which asked, “Don’t we have businesses in this city that can help the Government by advancing funds for the garrison?” This question was followed by an extortionate threat: “Aren’t the businesses afraid to remain exposed to the dangers that such scandalous and unique circumstances may bring about?” A second and more direct handbill blamed the “distorted avarice” of the Jews for the “misery and helplessness” of the populace. It claimed that “many daughters of Coro, previously models of virtue,” were being “prostituted by the Jews.” It concluded by warning the Jews to leave Coro. Two nights later, a band of 30 armed men wandered through the streets, according to Aizenberg, “shooting at Jewish homes, tearing doors down and looting the shops” belonging to prominent Jewish merchants.Like many at the time, Aizenberg believes that the military, wanting to intimidate the Jews into renewing their support, printed and distributed the leaflets, as well as supplied the manpower for the riots. Ironically, the strategy backfired. By February 10, the last of Coro’s Jews had fled the city on a ship sent by the government of Curacao to rescue its citizens.

That summer, Sir Moses Montefiore arrived in Bucharest and demanded that Prince Carol put a stop to the persecutions. Despite pledges to do so, the discrimination continued. Hundreds of families, harassed by humiliating regulations (e.g., a prohibition on building sukkot), were forced to leave the villages. Local officials regarded such persecution as an effective method of extorting bribes. Neither the repeated interventions of Great Britain and France nor the condemnatory resolutions in the parliaments of Holland and Germany had any effect. The Romanian government reiterated that the Jewish problem was an internal one, and the great powers limited themselves to protests.Their aim was also to create an anti-Semitic atmosphere on the eve of the session of parliament that was to decide on the modification of the article in the 1866 constitution concerning Jewish naturalization. Prince Carol, opening parliament, declared that the Jews had a harmful influence on economic life and especially on the peasants. After stormy debates, parliament modified the article of the constitution which made citizenship conditional on Christianity but stated that the naturalization of Jews would be carried out individually by vote of both chambers of parliament. During the following 38 years, 2,000 Jews in all were naturalized by this oppressive procedure; of those, 883 were voted in en bloc, having taken part in the 1877 war against Turkey. In 1866, Alexandru Ioan Cuza was ousted by anti-liberal forces. A new sovereign, Carol of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, was elected and a new constitution was adopted. Under the pressure of demonstrations organized by the police (during which the Choir Temple in Bucharest was demolished and the Jewish quarter plundered), the seventh article of the constitution, restricting citizenship to the Christian population, was adopted.

Another conspirator was baselessly rumored to be Jewish.[11] The extent to which the Russian press was responsible for encouraging perceptions of the assassination as a Jewish act has been disputed.[12]Local economic conditions (such as ancestral debts owed to Jewish moneylenders) are thought to have contributed significantly to the rioting, especially with regard to the participation of the business competitors of local Jews and the participation of railroad workers. Russia's industrialization caused Russians to be moving into and out of major cities.[13] People trying to escape the big cities carried their antisemitic values with them, spread the ideas throughout Russia, and caused more pogroms in different regions of Russia.[14] That has been argued to have been actually more important than rumors of Jewish responsibility for the death of the Tsar.[15] Those rumors, however, were clearly of some importance, if only as a trigger, and they drew upon a small kernel of truth: one of the close associates of the assassins, Hesya Helfman, was born into a Jewish home. The fact that the other assassins were all atheists and that the wider Jewish community had nothing to do with the assassination had little impact on the spread of such antisemitic rumors, and the assassination inspired retaliatory attacks on Jewish communities. During these pogroms, thousands of Jewish homes were destroyed; many families were reduced to poverty and large numbers of men, women and children were injured in 166 towns in the south-western provinces of the Empire, such as Ukraine.[citation needed]",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,,"Tsar assassination involved atheists and a jewish individual along with the impacts jews had on local economic conditions (such as ancestral debts owed to Jewish moneylenders) are thought to have contributed significantly to the rioting, especially with regard to the participation of the business competitors of local Jews and the participation of railroad workers.

Klier, professor of modern Jewish History at University College, London who spent almost his entire academic life researching Jewish life in Russian controlled territory, came to the conclusion that, far from passively allowing the pogroms to take place, the Tsarist government actively and repeatedly issued orders to the police, and military to suppress them.

This was the first instance in the Muslim world in which the Jew’s legal status changed so radically. The naturalization of some 35,000 Jews resulted in a wave of antisemitism. Jews were attacked and in Tlemcen in 1881, in Algiers in 1882, 1897, and 1898, in Oran and Sétif in 1883, and in Mostaganem in 1897, where the violence reached its peak. Up to 1900 there were in all towns and villages cases of looting and killing, and numerous cases of synagogues being sacked, and the Holy Scrolls desecrated and used as banners by the rioters. The Dreyfus affair in France inflamed the anti-Jewish campaign even more. An antisemitic party came to power: Edouard Drumont was elected the representative of Algiers and Max Regis became its mayor. Extraordinary measures were taken against the Jews. In Constantine, by decision of the deputy mayor Emile Morinaud, Jewish patients were not admitted to hospitals.

Limerick’s leading private lenders were Christians and ‘the credit extended by non-Jewish traders … dwarfed that supplied’ by Jews.[10]Creagh claimed in his first sermon that Limerick’s Mayor’s Court of Conscience (where small debts were recovered) had become ‘a special court for the whole benefit of the Jews’, who had taken 337 actions there in 1902 and 226 in 1903. These figures cannot be verified as the court ledgers for 1900-1908 have, mysteriously, been lost.What is clear is that an analysis of this court’s records for the periods prior to and post-1904 (viz. 1895/99 and 1909/17) indicates that Jewish traders were not then over-represented in terms of summonses issued.Nor were they over-represented in terms of county court actions, comprising ‘only a small fraction of the cases taken against debtors in Limerick city circuit court in the years before the boycott’.[11] Indeed, Levin provided figures of 31 of 1,387 in 1903 and 8 of 300 at the 1904 Easter sessions which, although spuriously contextualised, were not disputed by the Creagh side.[12]Moreover, while Creagh’s sermons may have been primarily directed against ‘Jewish trading methods’, it is abundantly clear from their texts that he had Judaism itself in his sights. His first sermon’s tirade against these ‘methods’ was carefully contextualized with Catholic theological Judaeophobia and the continental antisemitic conspiracy theory of the time: he had evidently been deeply influenced by the antisemitism prevailing in French clerical circles during the Dreyfus Affair. https://www.theirishstory.com/2020/07/05/revisiting-the-limerick-pogrom-of-1904/",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,,"In many cases their wives and children were virtually on the breadline.

Famous personalities from Bălți have included the artist Boris Anisfeld; the Hebrew writer Ya‘akov Fichmann; Yiddish authors Zelik Berdichever, Boris Sandler, and Michael Felsenbaum; and Lia van Leer, founder of the Jerusalem Cinematheque.Jews began to settle in Bălți in the middle of the eighteenth century. After their legal status was formally established in 1782, their numbers increased steadily—from 244 families in 1817 to 1,792 in 1847, rising to 4,365 in 1857. After May 1882, Russian laws prohibiting Jews to live in villages were rescinded, and by 1897 the number of Jews in Bălți had increased to 10,348 (56% of the population). In 1861, Bălți had 8 synagogues; by 1910 there were 14. Yisra’el Ioffe served as a rabbi from 1885. A network of Jewish institutions existed in 1930, including a teachers’ seminary, three elementary schools, two secondary schools, a school of commerce, a professional school for girls, a hospital, a home for the elderly, a cooperative credit bank, and libraries. Shurot, a Hebrew literary magazine, was issued in the town between 1935 and 1938.By 1930, Bălți’s 14,259 Jews constituted the majority (60%) of the town’s population. Their primary occupations were in commerce and handicrafts; some suburban dwellers also had farms. In 1925, of 1,539 members of Jewish cooperative credit banks, 656 were engaged in commerce, 441 in handicrafts, and 156 in agriculture. Antisemitism was rampant at the time, with pogroms and desecrations of the Jewish cemetery occasionally taking place. A major pogrom occurred on 15 June 1930. In 1929 and 1933, however, Jews were elected as deputy majors. Restrictions and poverty led to mass emigration from Bălți. At the end of June 1941, most of the town was destroyed by Romanian and German bombs. Jews escaped to neighboring villages, mainly to Valea-lui-Vlad, where many were murdered by local peasants. The town was captured by Nazi forces on 9 July 1941. A report of Einsatzgruppe D states that on 10 July, Romanian soldiers executed 400 Jews. In three camps near Bălți, many more Jews perished of starvation and disease; others were deported to Transnistria. After the war, Bălți regained its status as a large Jewish center, with more than 15,000 Jews living there in 1970. A synagogue functioned from 1946 to 1959, with Lieber Zalman serving as its rabbi. In 1988 Jewish cultural life saw a revival with the opening of Menoyre, a Yiddish musical theater. A page on Jewish topics in the local newspaper Golos Belts began to appear in 1991.

According to policy, Jewish immigrants to Ecuador were supposed to be employed in agriculture, but the authorities soon surmised that the immigrants were actually merchants, industrialists, and businessmen. As a result, legislation was passed in 1938 which compelled any Jew not engaged in agriculture or industry to leave the country.[10] In addition, entry rights were limited to only Jews who possessed a minimum of $400, which they would then be required to invest in an industrial project.",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,Americas,Tried to be inclusive but reality proved to widdle the country down to those that were economically advantageous to take-in out the gate,Economic Ringers

During the 1930s, the Jewish community became increasingly integrated into Albanian society, with official government recognition on 2 April 1937.[5] Zog went further and aided Jewish immigration to Albania and helped the integration of new Jewish arrivals.[6] In 1934, Herman Bernstein, the American ambassador to Albania, who was Jewish himself, remarked that Jews were not discriminated against in the country because it ""happens to be one of the rare lands in Europe today where religious prejudice and hate do not exist"".[5] With the rise of Nazism, a number of German Jews and Austrian Jews took refuge in Albania, and the Albanian embassy in Berlin continued to issue visas to Jews until the end of 1938, at a time when no other European country was willing to do so.[7][a] Bernstein played a critical role in persuading the Albanian government to continue issuing Jews tourist and transit visas. From 1933 onward, Bernstein's efforts resulted in many Jews escaping from Germany and Austria as the Nazi Party consolidated power, some of whom used Albania as a transit point from which to escape to the United States, Turkey, or South America.[ Then Italy took over with a protectorate state and refused to accept more Jews and deport the ones at the time that were there. The Italian protectorate of Albania, also known as the Kingdom of Albania or Greater Albania,[3][4] existed as a puppet state and protectorate of the Kingdom of Italy under Fascism. It was practically a union between Italy and Albania, officially led by Italy's King Victor Emmanuel III and its government: Albania was led by Italian governors, after being militarily occupied by Italy, from 1939 until 1943.

By mid-1941, the annexation increased “Great Hungary’s” Jewish population to 800,000.A “Third Jewish Law” was passed on August 8, 1941, prohibiting intermarriage and changing the definition of Jew to a racial definition. Many Christians thus became “Jews” and the estimated number of “Jews” may have actually been 850,000 in mid-1941.The first massacre of Hungarian Jews took place in July 1941 when 20,000 Hungarian Jews were expelled from the Galicia region, in Kamentes-Podolski, where the SS and Hungarian troops killed them in the autumn of 1941. Another massacre of 1,000 Jews took place in January 1942, in Bacska region. A third set of Jews, about 50,000, died on the battlefield against the Soviets.Also in 1942, Hungary’s Prime Minister, Miklos Kallay, ordered that Jewish property be expropriated and he restricted the economic and cultural life of Jews. He proposed a “final solution of the Jewish question,” calling for the resettlement of 800,000 Jews. The Arrow Cross party in Hungary was also responsible for anti-Jewish rhetoric, as well as for persecution.By 1943, Jews were no longer involved in Hungary’s public and cultural life; however, the Kallay government began holding secret talks with the allies and toned down its anti-Jewish rhetoric.Germany occupied Hungary in March 1944 because Kallay did not deport the Jews, which was seen as cooperation with the allies. By the time of the German occupation, 63,000 Hungarian Jews had been killed.In April 1944, Adolph Eichmann ordered the removal of 400,000 Jews from the provincial towns, cities and villages around Hungary to ghettos. Deportation to Auschwitz began in May 1944. All communities besides those in Budapest were put in ghettos or concentration camps.

In these pogroms, as in the later persecution and Aktionen, the Lithuanians again took a very active part. The Slobodka ghetto contained 29,760 people. Following an Aktion there, 9,200 Jews were killed at the Ninth Fort situated near Slobodka on October 29, 1941. Another 20,000 with their belongings were sent there from Germany, Austria, France, and other European countries – for ""resettlement in the East"" – and murdered. Another 4,000 ghetto residents were murdered in various other Aktionen between August and December 1941. Two ""resettlement actions"" took place in 1942 in which Jews from Kaunas ghetto were transferred to *Riga. On Oct. 26, 1943, approximately 3,000 Jews were deported to concentration camps in Estonia. The ghetto was then turned into ""concentration camp Kauen."" At this time the united Jewish underground, which had been operating in the ghetto from the end of 1941 and had 800 members, began sending people to the Augustova forests (74 mi. (120 km.) south of Kaunas) to join the partisan resistance against the Germans. Through lack of experience and the hostility of the local population many of the members of the underground were killed or captured. A group of them, who were employed by the *Gestapo in burning the corpses of the victims in the Ninth Fort, managed to escape on Christmas Eve of 1943. They were then sent by the ghetto underground to the forests of Rudnicka (about 90 mi. (150 km.) east of Kaunas) and were absorbed into the Soviet partisan units, which comprised various national groups. From the fall of 1943 to the spring of 1944, the underground, aided by members of the Aeltestenrat (see *Judenrat), especially its chairman, Elhanan *Elkes, and the Jewish ghetto police, managed to send about 250 armed fighters to Rudnicka and other forests, where more than one-third were killed in action against the Germans. The leader of the underground, Chaim Yelin, was captured and killed by the Gestapo. A group of Jewish partisans died in a clash with Gestapo forces on the outskirts of Kaunas in April 1944. On March 27–28, 1944, another special Aktion took place in which 2,000 children, elderly and sick persons were hunted down. When the Soviet attack began in July 1944, the Germans liquidated the Kaunas ghetto and concentration camps in the area, using grenades and explosives, to kill the Jews hiding in the bunkers. In this Aktion about 8,000 Jews and others were sent to Germany. The men were sent to *Dachau and the women to *Stutthof, and over 80% of them died in these camps before liberation.

1943,"Hamilton, Bermuda",Christianity,United Kingdom,Colony,"The Bermuda Conference was an international conference between the United Kingdom and the United States held from April 19 to 30, 1943, at Hamilton, Bermuda. The topic of discussion was the question of Jewish refugees who had been liberated by Allied forces and those who still remained in Nazi-occupied Europe. The only agreement reached was that the war must be won against the Nazis. US immigration quotas were not raised, and the British prohibition on Jewish refugees seeking refuge in Mandatory Palestine was not lifted. | During World War II, Jewish and general public opinion in the United States and the British Commonwealth urgently demanded that the Allied governments rescue the victims of the Nazi regime. Under pressure from parliament, churches, and humanitarian organizations, the British Foreign Office, on January 20, 1943, proposed joint consultation between Britain and the United States to examine the problem and possible solutions. This Summary of Recommendations discussed potential projects that would only rescue small numbers of refugees, suggested issuing a joint declaration promising the return of refugees after the war, and funding, mandate, membership, and potential projects for the Intergovernmental Committee On Refugees (IGRC).After seven months – on December 10, 1943 – the report of the conference was published. Its only positive decision – to revive the Evian Committee – came too late to save a single Jew from the Holocaust.(JVL) |The conference took place on the island of Bermuda in the North Atlantic Ocean, a location chosen because it was remote. This meant that, although there was widespread global interest in the conference, very few people were able to actually attend. Throughout the conference, the Allies used the ongoing Second World War to justify their lack of action to save Jews and rejection of the suggested rescue proposals.  The Allies believed that winning the war was the most effective way to end the genocide, and that taking any other action in the meantime would delay victory and continue the Nazis’ persecution for longer.In the end, after twelve days of discussion, two concrete agreements came out of the conference.The first was the idea to remove a small number of refugees from Spain and establish another refugee camp in North Africa (the North African Refugee Centre ), in order to create more space in Spain for refugees escaping Nazi Europe over the Pyrenees Mountains. The second was the revival of the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees , which had been largely defunct since the 1938 Evian Conference.

While the Revolution did not target Jews specifically, they did suffer economically along with other members of Cuba’s middle class. Many Jews were initially sympathetic to the Cuban Revolution of 1959 under Fidel Castro, seeing the change in leadership as an opportunity to rid Cuba of the corruption that was associated with the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. In the early stages of the revolution, it was not evident that Castro's plans were to ally Cuba with the communist bloc.[6] As Castro's plans became clear, Jewish Cubans who had emigrated from Eastern and Central Europe became increasingly concerned with the impending revolution, as a result of their prior experience with religious intolerance associated with Leninist policies and Bolshevik Russia.[7] During the earliest days of the revolution, the most paramount concern for the Jewish Cuban population was the nationalization of industry and agriculture and the laws which supported it. These measures include the first and second Agrarian Reform Laws, Law 851, and the First Urban Reform Law. The Agrarian Reform Laws of 1959 and 1963 caused strife amongst Jewish landowners and farmers, as the government began eradicating all landed estates and foreign-owned land, in addition to nationalizing all properties and buildings exceeding 67 hectares.

Approximately 3000 Jews are now in these refugee camps, and some visitors to the camps indicate that their situation is even more urgent than that of Jews who remain in Ethiopia. https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/plight-ethiopian-jews",1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,"Effectively ghettos, Refusnik like program but there are escapees","Illiterate, hardly advanced, just more proof against the version that it is in fact 'Jewish excellence' but describing something else https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/plight-ethiopian-jews",Outgroup - Undue Influence/Takeover

Details of this connection and how the condition of Iranian Jews improved dramatically in a few short years still awaits rigorous exploration.[73]Even though Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was very positive towards religious minorities, and especially Jews, in the beginnings of his reign as king, he displayed antisemitic tendencies in the last decade of his rule.

It was estimated that Jews were disproportionately represented (some sources maintain by as much as 2,500%) among whites involved in anti-apartheid political activities.[26] Much like other English-speaking white South Africans, Jews supported either the Progressive Party or the United Party. One organisation, the Union of Jewish Women, sought to alleviate the suffering of blacks through charitable projects and self-help schemes. Fourteen of the 23 whites involved in the 1956 Treason Trial were Jewish and all five whites of the 17 members of the African National Congress who were arrested for anti-apartheid activities in 1963 were Jewish.Some Jewish university students vehemently opposed the apartheid movement. A large number of Jews were also involved in organisations such as the Springbok Legion, the Torch Commando and the Black Sash. These anti-apartheid organisations led protests that were both active (e.g. marching through the streets with torches) and passive (e.g. standing silently in black). Two Jewish organisations were formed in 1985: Jews for Justice (in Cape Town) and Jews for Social Justice (in Johannesburg). They tried to reform South African society and build bridges between the white and black communities. The South African Jewish Board also passed a resolution rejecting apartheid in 1985.[27]In addition to the well-known high profile Jewish anti-apartheid personalities, there were very many ordinary Jews who expressed their revulsion of apartheid in diverse ways and contributed to its eventual downfall. Many Jews actively provided humanitarian assistance for black communities. Johannesburg's Oxford Synagogue and Cape Town's Temple Israel established nurseries, medical clinics and adult education programs in the townships and provided legal aid for victims of apartheid laws. Many Jewish lawyers acted as nominees for non-whites who were not allowed to buy properties in white areas.[28]In 1980, South Africa's National Congress of the Jewish Board of Deputies passed a resolution urging ""all concerned [people] and, in particular, members of our community to cooperate in securing the immediate amelioration and ultimate removal of all unjust discriminatory laws and practices based on race, creed, or colour"".
