# BareMinimumEE-EE Warning + List Dictionary

## Known Issues:
* Sources cited vary in depth by region and time period
    * What does this mean?
        * Italy, thanks to a Jewish author C. Roth’s thorough provision of expulsions was popular on existing circulated lists thus many more expulsions are represented out of Italy with poor comparable sources to that kind of coverage. Russia on more than one occasion is listed as just Russia when in one example that included 126+ cities deciding more or less in waves to expel. The Rhine land, areas of Eastern Europe, etc all make note of the sheer volume of cities not reflected in the specificity that is likely available.
        * Due to record keeping and technology changes over a close to 3,000 year sample of history, certain ages have limitations as specific as the few who would even record the history and how they choose to record it (arguably still true today even with the advantages of current record keeping). 
        * The number of Jews expelled due to these differences can vary at times to extremes and are not adequately reflected in this list.
        * There was not literature review of any kind done prior to or during the creation of this list.
        * The sources are increasingly limited by specificity and earlier year.
* Previous lists accepted a wide net for what was termed an expulsion 
    * See description of column ‘Expelled’
* Non-standardized production
    * A single human evaluator was marking/assessing these 
        * In a rather lazy manner I might add, there are likely (virtually certain) irregularities that need correcting  
* Capturing sheer population across space was not attempted and violence has not been scaled
    * 3 columns may be completely revised
        * ‘Violence < 50’ and ‘Violence > 49’ will likely be merged given how eve an attempt to capture size was so poorly/lazily done, it isn’t clear that just the lack of a city noted was more than enough information. Additional ‘ES/R,’ originally ‘ATNL’ ie Additional Towns Not Listed, was also and lazy and failed attempt to grasp the magnitude and reach of an expulsion or persecution event. 
* Governing body was included to help contextualize
    * It is not a means of alone creating an apples to apples comparison. 

## What the Lists Include:

The following lists are based on readily circulated lists regarding Jewish expulsions. The list of known issues are good things to keep in mind but is by no means comprehensive. Please keep in mind the title: ‘The Bare Minimum.’ These expulsion lists were clearly missing the proper pair of entrances (still under construction at this time) to help fill in that picture. Additionally, without verifying from other sources, they are often shared without sources or description. This remedies that in the mildest, high level sense and not much more. The cited reason for expulsion is attempted to be captured and tagged in the final column. If it was violent, if it was largely symbolic, etc are included to help fill this picture. 

This is an overview and likely best serves in its general purpose without exceptionally greater specificity the earlier the information is attempted to be captured in human history. It is a nice complement to more present day analysis that needs the legs of something like this. It does appear based on initial tagging efforts to support the exploration of certain patterns; however, it is important to note that could be every bit the artifact of the era of its collection more so than an accurate account of the occurrence. This is by no means a hidden history or a deep dive. For more information, please see the description of the ‘Verified’ column. Please do not overstate findings, information, etc if you choose to share. It isn’t necessary and doesn’t make this any less impactful. Please do contribute. 

## Invitation/Follow Up: 
* Additional evaluators needed (as important for standardization as it is to assess categories)
* Verification of unverified items
* Potentially reducing the tagged categories per report on another page and expanding the granularity captured in the list
* Literature review to better contextualize and validate information found and missing here 
* Inclusion of similar depth in other regions to that of Italy 
* Clean description column and provide a separate column for sources ideally rated by quality
* Religions were originally more specific but for the sake of the bare minimum was corrected to just the general religion - if anyone cares to correct, please do
* Etc.
